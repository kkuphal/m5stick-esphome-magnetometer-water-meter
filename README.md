# m5stick-esphome-magnetometer-water-meter [![Made for ESPHome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_for-ESPHome-black?logo=esphome)](https://esphome.io)

This [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) package allows reading your water meter using an [M5StickC Plus](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit) and a [6-DoF IMU Pro Mini Unit](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/6-dof-imu-pro-mini-unit-bmi270-bmm150-bmp280) with a BMM150 triple-axis magnetometer.

Much of the magnetometer logic in this package was built from tronikos' [esphome-magnetometer-water-gas-meter](https://github.com/tronikos/esphome-magnetometer-water-gas-meter) project
Additional help from the [M5Unit-IMU-Pro-Mini](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unit-IMU-Pro-Mini) repository

Since I have almost zero soldering skills, this was a far easier project than building my own circuits as tronikos did.

Hope you find this helpful
